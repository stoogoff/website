Civil war rages across Elevar, from the ice wastes of Fjiorl in the North to the searing deserts of Kallamra in the South. Ilias Brand, Knight Commander of the Holy Order of Atar, the military and spiritual order which protects the Republic of Elevar, strives for peace and finds love.

Not everyone in Elevar is a noble knight or scheming senator. Against the backdrop of war there are those just trying to get by or to turn a profit.

**ABC Worriers** was an unsuccessful [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/). The game is incomplete and not playable in a meaningful way. The theme was *An Unconventional Weapon* and the idea was to build different weapons to fight off different types of aliens. Unfortunately that proved too complex to complete in 48 hours.

The name was a spoof of the [ABC Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Warriors) comic from 2000AD.

**Drowning Man** was a [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) idea I initially swithered on. It seemed just a bit too depressing but the theme was *Beneath the Surface* and I kept going back to an endless "runner" game where the character is swimming for their life beneath the surface of the ice. It seemed fitting.

It was the first time I used a third party library for development, rather than writing everything myself. Drowning Man was written using the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) library which is an incredible, and incredibly well documented, game development library covering everything you need.

The music is a subtle nod to [The Drowning Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJmE0C4Tq1U) by [the Cure](https://www.thecure.com/), which is based on a scene from Gormenghast. All of which ties back to the theme of the game.

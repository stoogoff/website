  [Silver Hand][silver] returns to Ilias's adventures during the Elevar civil war and how he finds a replacement for his missing arm. The story is inspired by a number of [myths][nuada] and [legends][sigurd] and loosely follows the [Hero's Journey][journey] (travel to a strange place, stuff, setbacks, stuff, riches, return). The writing is highly stylised in a pseudo-Medieval fashion heavily influenced by Mallory's [Le Morte d'Arthur][morte]. I'm an avid reader of Medieval literature but by no means an expert, so there are likely errors which would sound horrendous to an expert's ears.

  I love writing in this style as it feels very minimalist and is all about the immediate action â€” description is overlooked unless it's absolutely relevant. When I'm writing normally I often feel like I'm getting bogged down in too many irrelevant details, with this style there's none of that (this may be part of why I love [Chuck Palahniuk's][chuck] work as he's similarly light on description).

  Silver Hand was originally written towards the end of 2007 and required surprisingly little editing. I don't know if that's because I was writing a lot at the time and improving my craft or due to the style of the piece. Probably the style!

  If you read Silver Hand please feel free to write a review, I'd love to hear what you think about it!

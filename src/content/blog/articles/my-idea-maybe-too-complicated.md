title: My Idea Maybe Too Complicated
summary: |
  After going through various ideas of 2D beat-em ups involving clowns battling with daffodils, lawyers sueing each other or fighting off zombies with household implements (a la [Shaun of the Dead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/)) I'm settling on something I'm calling **ABC Worriers<sup>1</sup>**.

  Earth is being invaded by aliens and only you can stop them!

  Your weapons are:

  **The Atom Bomb** Destroy everything in the blast radius! Be warned, distant enemies may become... strange.

  **The Biological Virus** Create viral bugs and set them set on the aliens. Be warned, some bugs may make the aliens stronger.

  **The Chemicals** Use your chemistry skills to create strange weapons of your own and fight off the aliens your self!

  I'm thinking the biological and chemical weapons are something you make yourself with various pick ups on the map and the A bomb is something to buy you some time.

  This could make for a fun game but I may have also bitten off more than I can chew...

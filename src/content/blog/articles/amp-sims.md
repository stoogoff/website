title: Amp Sims
summary: |
  Just before [Nasoalmo][naso] I tried out a mix of [free amp simulators][free]. I wanted to see what kind of guitar sounds I could get from a direct line into the computer using an amp sim, rather than micing up my sturdy Marshall amp.

  My respect for amp sims has kind of wavered. When I remixed [Monkeys in Space][monkeys] earlier in the <time datetime="2013">year</time> I was incredibly impressed with a free Kuassa sim (I can't find a link to this, it may have come with a magazine). When I recorded Monkeys in Space I had minimal gear so all the guitars were recorded through my [Boss effects board][boss] via a 1/4" jack to USB cable. That set up did not make for a very good guitar sound! Adding the Kuassa amp to the guitars was a massive improvement and I was initially impressed with the options available.

  Between Naso 2012 and Naso 2013 I upgraded my recording set up. I'm now using a [Scarlet 2i2][scarlet] from [Focusrite][focus], which is a big improvement over the jack to USB cable, and I've picked up a decent mic and stand so I can easily record straight from my Marshall. Now I can finally record my guitar and have it sound exactly the way I play. As a guitarist, this is awesome!

  For the record, the amp I'm using is a [Marshall VS100R][marshall]. It's a hybrid valve / tube and solid state circuit amp, which I've had for around sixteen or seventeen years. It's an absolute beast and has survived many a gig with [Rome Burns][rb] and the Yams. It's been sat on, knocked over, doused in beer and cider, lost three of its feet but I've never had a problem with it. It still has the best distortion sound, way better than any tweaking of my effects board can produce.

  And that's a bit of a problem. When it came to evaluating amp sims they all fell short. Nothing compared to plugging in my amp and cranking up the distortion. For an album like [Dream by Day][dream] where there are four guitars competing for audio space different sounding amps would have been a good thing. The guitars themselves have some effect on the sound but not as big an effect as the amp. When I started recording Dream by Day I double tracked the guitars, so I had the mic'ed amp sound as well as a direct line. I tried adding a few amp sims to the direct line to compare with the real amp and, for the most part, ditched the direct line audio as unusable. The mistake I made here was to compare the different recording methods with each other, rather than listen to the sound of the song as a whole.

  I did use some of the direct line audio, mainly for the [8-string][8string] and acoustic. The 8-string was used for a lot of clean sounds and I added some chorus to the direct line and kept it low in the mix to compliment the amp sound. That worked incredibly well and is used on a few tracks. The acoustic guitar was also entirely recording without an amp. It has a pick up built in which I plugged straight in to the Scarlet. No matter where I tried positioning a mic I couldn't get a better sound than the one straight from the guitar itself.

  When I recorded [Dat Bass][db] (ironically titled, as no bass guitar was used, that's the 8-string you can hear), I had one guitar part left to add and it was too late to switch the amp on. So I recorded it directly from the effects board into the Scarlett and added an amp sim afterwards.

  And it works brilliantly.

  If I didn't know I wouldn't be able to tell it was an amp sim. To me it sounds like a guitar. It doesn't sound like _my_ guitar but it still sounds like _a_ guitar, and, more importantly, it fits in perfectly with the song.

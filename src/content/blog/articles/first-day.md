title: First Day
summary: |
  The first day is almost over and it's been fairly productive. Artwork was tricky but that's my major weak spot. I haven't quite got all of the things I wanted done but it's pretty close. Tomorrow will be spent doing some character animations, some music and polishing the game play.

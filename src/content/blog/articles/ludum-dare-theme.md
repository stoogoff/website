title: Ludum Dare Theme
summary: |
  This <time datetime="2014">year's</time> theme has just been announced and it's *Beneath the Surface*. It wasn't one I voted for and I'm not entirely sure what to do with it. My initial thought is someone trapped under ice but I don't know how I can make that into a game just yet.

## Monkeys in Space 2

This is sort of a sequel to my last Nanowrimo, which was about an advanced, space-faring culture meeting a similar species with a much more primitive culture. This idea is a sort of part 2 in that it's based on my original notes for last year but isn't necessarily a sequel to last year's offering. In this not-quite-part-2 an archaeologist discovers multiple Neanderthal remains with intact DNA sequences. Thirty years later, with significant advances in technology, the sequences are cloned and the children are raised in an attempt to study the Neanderthal species. Except one of the children turns out very different to the others...

## King Arthur in the Wild West

This has been in the back of my mind for a few months now. The idea is to retell some of the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table but to set it in the American Wild West period. I was initially very keen to do this, and I have a tonne of character notes, but it was pointed out to me that this had already [been done in comic form][calibre]. I'm still tempted to pursue the idea, as I think I can put an original spin on it, so it's definitely an option.

## King Arthur, the Hell's Angel

I've been playing a lot of [GTA][gta] recently (IV, not V, I *am* [behind the times][yellow]) as well as watching [Breaking Bad][breakingbad] and [Sons of Anarchy][soa]. So all of my recent entertainment has involved a lot of crime and criminal related drama. My girlfriend pointed out that something like Sons of Anarchy, a show featuring criminal bikers and biker gangs, could work very well as a replacement for knights. With a few changes my character notes for King Arthur in the Wild West would fit into this new setting.

I'm not sure which of the ideas I'm leaning towards at the moment, but I've only got a few days left to choose.

There are some interesting things in there, most of which I can work with. I've voted against *Companion*. I could work with that as a theme if I had to but I'm not overly keen on it as it immediately reminds me of the hours spent cajoling followers in Morrowind. I've got a few ideas ready in case it comes up as it was very popular on the forums.

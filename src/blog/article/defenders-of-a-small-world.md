title: Defenders of a Small World
summary: |
  I'm pretty sure I had to do *A Small World* for my very first [LD][ld] in 2012. I didn't finish but you can see [a video of the game play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_JuDYU3y-M) on youtube.

My idea for this year is to have a giant planet-eating monster floating around the solar system. The player will either be a small spaceship trying to defend the solar system by killing the monster or the monster fending off tiny spaceships so it can have some planet-sized snacks.

I want to have a somewhat realistic planetary model with semi-authentic gravity which gets messed up by the monster and the disappearing planets. That might be a bit complicated so I'll see what that involves first.

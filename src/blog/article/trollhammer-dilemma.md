title: Trollhammer Dilemma
summary: |
  Game play dilemma: I was going to have it so when Troll jumps and lands the camera shakes and the villagers pause for a second. This gives Troll the chance to catch everyone. This is very powerful so I was going to temper it by giving Troll a five second recovery period.

The problem is the recovery period might become the player's downfall if they can't jump just before a chasm. Which seems a bit unfair.

title: Monkeys in Space
summary: |
  In 2012 I attempted [Nasoalmo](http://www.nasoalmo.org/) for the first time while simultaneously writing a novel for [Nanowrimo](http://nanowrimo.org/). To make it slightly easier on myself the album was a concept album based on the novel and they're both called **Monkeys in Space**.

  Though they were meant to be the same, the album and novel tell a slightly different story. The album is much more direct and hopefully the story can be understood through the music and the track titles. If I find time between the other writing I'm doing I may try and release the novel at some point.

  I've remixed the album into a shorter EP. One track didn't make the cut and the rest have been cleaned up and remixed. While they still have a few warts, they sound a lot better than they did, and I'm pleased with how it's turned out.

  I've made the remixed version of [Monkeys in Space][mis] available for free on [Bandcamp][bandcamp]. Of course, you can pay for it if you want!

  ## Music Style

  For the music I wanted to emphasise the two cultures clashing aspect of the novel. I'd planned to have two unique music styles which would merge later on in the album. I feel I was partially successful with this. The two unique styles is immediately apparent between [Specimen][specimen] and [At the Court of the King][king], for example. I don't think I really got the merging of styles the way I wanted it. There's some reuse of melody lines in [Relentless][relentless] but that's about as far as I got.

  What I was most pleased with is the tribal style of music used for [In the Night Sky][sky], [Hunter of Men][hunter] and [At the Court of the King][king]. I struggled to get the mix right for [Heliosphere][heliosphere] during [Naso][naso], and it shows on the original version, but the three tribal tracks came together easily.

  Don't forget to have a listen to [Monkeys in Space][mis]!

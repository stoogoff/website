## Stage One

1. Troll runs along with his / her club
1. Houses appear in the distance
1. As the troll gets closer villagers run from the houses
1. Game speeds up
1. Troll can smash the houses (some points)
1. Some of the villagers fall behind
1. Troll can reach and hit the stragglers (yay, lots of points!)
    - Or jump on them
    - Jump causes the ground to shake and the villagers to slow down
1. Eventually a chasm appears:
    - All the remaining villagers fall in (boo, very few points)
    - Troll has to jump the chasm or die
1. Repeat

## Stage Two

After a few repetitions some villagers are armed with pitchforks!

- Some armed villagers come after Troll, others run away
- Troll can't jump on them they hurt his / her feet!
- Troll has to jump over them

## Stage Three

After a few repetitions the terrain becomes uneven!

- Troll can trip over
- If Troll trips the villagers swarm and kill him

*This may be tricky due to the animation involved.*

## Stage Four

After a few repetitions a castle wall appears with a catapult behind it!

- Troll must jump the castle wall
- Troll can smash (by jumping or with club) the catapult
- The catapult fires at Troll
- Troll can jump over the missiles or block with club

Rinse. Repeat. Etc.

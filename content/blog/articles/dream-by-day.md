[Dream by Day][dbd] is an instrumental album written as a guitar quartet. I came up with the idea because I now own four guitars, each with its own unique playing characteristics and playing sound. The four guitars are an Ibanez acoustic, an ancient Washburn A20-V, an Indie Black Jack, and my recently acquired Ibanez 8-string. Obviously the acoustic sounds different to the electrics and the 8-string is a radically different playing experience to all of them but there are significant differences between the other two electrics as well. The Black Jack is a solid, chunky, Les Paul style guitar compared to the long scale, sleek and fast A20-V.

Each track is written with each guitar used once. Each guitar has a role in each track and, _generally_, sticks within the confines of that role (the exceptions being [Consider Tension][consider], where the 8-string flits between bass and melody, and [Solo Guitar with Delay][solo]). I wanted it to sound as if it were four people sitting in a room playing together, rather than an impossible to play, multi-layered thing constructed in a studio somewhere. Even if it was actually constructed in a studio...

Mostly I feel I achieved what I set out to. There are some warts to the album and bits I'd like to clean up ([Cryptic][cryptic], I'm looking at you) but, overall, I'm _way_ more pleased with this year's Nasoalmo than I was with last year's. I'm pleased with it enough that I want to continue the concept, possibly with a cover of the Game of Thrones theme. I think that could work well. Speaking of covers, the last song on Dream by Day is [The Last Man][last], from the [The Fountain][film] soundtrack by [Clint Mansell][clint], of [PWEI][pwei] fame. If you haven't seen the film I would highly recommend it, it's amazing. The sountrack is PHENOMENAL!

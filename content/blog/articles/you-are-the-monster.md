title: You are the Monster
summary: |
  I managed some brain storming before I slept last night and I came up with a few ideas. Initially I was thinking of a taking a classic arcade game and switching the roles so the player took on the part of the bad guy from the game. Space Invaders where you're the aliens or Pacman where you're the ghosts. I'm not convinced the game play would be interesting enough for that.

Then I got to thinking about different types of monster e.g. vampires, werewolves, zombies, trolls, Frankenstein's monster. Frankenstein's monster on the rampage where he has to rebuild himself could be interesting, but in the end I ditched it.

I liked the rampaging bit but having a character rebuild itself is going to get complicated quickly and over-complexity is why I didn't finish last time. So I stripped it back and I'm doing an endless runner style where the player takes on the role of a troll and has to chase and smash villagers. I'm calling it Trollhammer.

No, this isn't because I've been listening to too much [Finntroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhi43RntJk).

  It was originally written for the [Monkeys in Space EP][monkeys] which I wrote for [Nasoalmo in 2013][sg]. This is a different version to the one found on the album. A few weeks ago I found a treasure trove of remixes and half worked on pieces of music that I'd completely forgotten about. A rough, but almost complete, reworking of In the Night Sky was among that treasure trove, so I've remixed it using some of the new instrumentation I have available and here it is.

  I'm working on completing a new album in a similar alternative rock / folk / electro style, with demo releases similar to this one every few weeks. So have a listen and expect to hear more soon!

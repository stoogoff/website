title: Half Way There
summary: |
  It's just past the half way mark and I've got... something. The basics of the game play are in place, although there are few features I'd like to add, and a lot of the graphics are in place.

Tomorrow will be spent animating Troll and the Humans and working on some suitably sinister music.

Screen grab of the game so far:

The big green square is Troll. The small white rectangles are humans.

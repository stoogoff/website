title: Ludum Dare Tech
summary: |
  I'm using this [Ludum Dare][ld] as an opportunity to try out some new technology. I'm going to use [Phaser][phaser] for development along with [Browserify][brow] and possibly [Yeoman][yeo] for various package management. All that requires [Node][node] to be installed, which I don't have on my main development machine so that's first.
    
  [brow]: http://browserify.org/
  [ld]: http://www.ludumdare.com/
  [phaser]: http://phaser.io/
  [yeo]: http://yeoman.io/
  [node]: http://nodejs.org/

Fifteen minutes to go, plenty of time to get everything set up!

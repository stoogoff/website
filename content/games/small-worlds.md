**Small Worlds** is another [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) entry. It's a totally retro space ship shooter with some funky synth music to back it. The *Eater of Worlds* is devouring planets and you must pilot your spacecraft through the solar system and shoot it down!

I played this so many times during the development that I got really good at it. Which means it's insanely difficult to play and I can no longer complete it.
